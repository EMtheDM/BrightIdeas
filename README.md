## MVP

```
As a simple and concise project management system we want to be able to create and manage new projects. After creating a simple login and sign up page/form we used GET/POST routes in the creation of the different projects with the info form we have on the profile/home page. After retrieving the data any time we click on a project we can then route that data to the correct column or task. We used new technology in the form of a CSS library that animates the text on our pages.

```
## Technologies Used
```
Node.js
Express.js
MySQL
Sequelize
GET and POST Routes
API keys
Cookies and Session
New CSS Library

```
## Acceptance Criteria

```
WHEN I click on the link/app
THEN I am taken to the login page
WHEN I input all the asked for information and click on the sign-up button
